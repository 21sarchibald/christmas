                <p class="tree-decorating-items" id="tree-decorating-p">This family activity gets everybody in the
                    holiday spirit and helps everyone to have a fun time preparing your home for Christmas. Itâ€™s an
                    activity that can be enjoyed by people of all ages.</p>

                <h2 id="cookies-title">Making/Decorating Cookies</h2>
                <p class="cookies-items" id="cookies-p">This is a fun activity that can be done in the comfort of your
                    own home. The whole group gets to work together to bake a delicious product. After making and
                    shaping the cookies, the whole group gets to show off their artistic abilities by decorating the
                    cookies. The cookies can either all be eaten by the group, or this activity could become a service
                    activity if the group decides to drop off cookies to their friends, neighbors, or family.</p>

                <h2 id="christmas-lights-title">Seeing Christmas Lights</h2>
                <p class="christmas-lights-items" id="christmas-lights-p">This is an inexpensive and fun family activity
                    that can be done with people of all ages. Families can appreciate the joy of the Christmas season as
                    they look at the lights either on houses around their neighborhood or lights put up on trees in
                    their community. This activity can either be done on its own, or a group could treat themselves to
                    hot chocolate afterwards to warm up from the cold.</p>

                <h2 id="gift-exchange-title">Secret Santa Gift Exchange</h2>
                <img class="gift-exchange-items" id="gift-exchange" src="images/gift-exchange.jpg"
                    alt="Someone preparing a Christmas gift">
                <p class="gift-exchange-items" id="gift-exchange-p">This is a fun activity where each person gets the
                    name of another person in the group. Then, their responsibility is to buy an inexpensive gift for
                    that person but to keep it a secret. Everyone in the group then gets together and gives each other
                    their gift closer to Christmas time.</p>
                <h2 id="caroling-title">Christmas Caroling</h2>
                <p class="caroling-items" id="caroling-p">This is a great way to bring the Christmas spirit to the group
                    and to spread Christmas cheer. Caroling is another inexpensive and fun activity that can be done
                    outdoors. It can also be done as service if the group wants to sing to a group who might need some
                    extra happiness during the Christmas season. For example, singing to a group at a care center or
                    perhaps a neighbor who might be lonely could be a great way to bring joy to them and to those they
                    sing to.</p>
